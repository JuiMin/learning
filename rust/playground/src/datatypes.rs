Scalars and Compounds

Rust is statically typed (thank god)
    - Sometimes it can guess the types based on the values
        - ex. string literals or integer literals don't need annotations
        - resolving an object from a function is more vague and requires
            annotations so we don't get compiler errors


Scalar Types
- Singular value
- Four types of scalars
    - Integers, Floats, Booleans, Characters

In release mode, integer overflow will result in automatic wrapping to prevent
panic errors (which we would see in debug mode)

There is a wrapping crate that facilitates this so don't use the release functionality
as part of the logic because this is considered a bug


Compound types
This is also pretty much what you expect
- Tuples and arrays

Tuple
    - FIxed length and is the general default for grouping several values of varying types
Array:
    - Fixed length and all values contained must be of the same type
    - Automatically go to the stack because all values are same type (size known) and the
    array itself has a defined size (so we can easily define it on the stack)

Vector (extra credit)
    - availabe in the standard library and is similar to the array except is resizable

    // println!("This is a tuple: {}", tup);
    // This doesn't work because the tuple doesn't implement display
    
    // Lets try destructuring the tuple
    let (a, b, c) = tup;
    println!("This is a tuple: {}, {}, {}", a, b, c);

    // We can also access via indexing but with the . not tup[0]

    let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
    "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];

    // Arrays don't implement display either
    // I think at this point it should be safe to assume that all collections have this problem
    // println!("Months of the year: {}", months);
    println!("January == {}", months[0]);
    // Note that indexing is with brackets and not the dots.

    // let a: [i32; 5] = [1,2,3,4,5];
    // Type annotation for the array (or I guess part of the definition?)
    // The type and the size is described

    // Fast definition initialization
    // Creates an array with all the same value and some size
    let b = [5;10];
    // here b is an array of length 10 with all entries being 5
    for idx in 0..10 {
        println!("{}", b[idx]);
    }

    // Be wary of index out of bounds because this is probably possible
    // The following will panic at compile time
    // let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    We can have signed and unsigned integers of varying sizes
    Up to 128 bit integers for both
    obviously implemented using two's complement

    arch - what the heck is this?
        - it literally means what architectures is the system
        - most computers are either 32 or 64 bit
        - isize and usize correspond to signed and unsigned integers based on the
            architecture bit base
                - So my computer is running 64 bit everything so each would correspond
                - to i64 and u64
            - This is probably helpful for older systems but 64 bit is the modern age so
            - Ignore using anything less probably unless you need the software super portable
            
            - MOST COMMON USE CASE FOR isize and usize
                - indexing some kind of collection

    General observation is that 32 bit integers are still the best even on 64 bit systems
