/*
Ownership the big daddy strat for memory control

Enables memory safe guarantees without a garbage collector
*/

/*
Ownership rules are checked at compile time and not runtime

Review the stack and the heap
Stack - structured and easy to allocate memory for
Heap - random as fuck
    - obviously finding a space to put stuff in the heap is expensive


Accessing data in the heap is also slower
    - Processors are faster if they jump around less (less ops)
    - Heap objects may be disjoint (think linked lists) so you might have to look around
        a lot for things you need
            - by comparison, everything in the stack is next to it's related data

managing heap data is why ownership exists
*/

/*
THE RULES

Each value in Rust has a variable that’s called its owner.

- Does this refer to the variable you instantiated?

There can only be one owner at a time.

- Hm... references must all be copies?

When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

- Reference counting?
- No because there's only one reference so we don't need to count


variable assignment is copy reference by value
    - references are always stored in the stack
    - the heap data that the pointer points to is unchanged and uncopied

fn invalidating_variables() {
    // let s1 = String::from("hello");
    // let s2 = s1;

    // println!("{}, world!", s1);

    // The above doesn't work because we invalidate the first copy
    // So we copy the pointer+metadata on the stack to s2, invalidate s1
    // and then we only have one copy of the information to work with

    // Assumption is that Rust never does deep copies automatically
}

fn deepcopy() {
    // There might be more functions that accomplish this but clone
    // could be considered the deep copy equivalent

    // In this case, a new pointer,len, and cap are created on the stack
    // and point to a completely new area of memory on the heap where we copied the data

    // Because it's dealing with the heap, deep copies are generally expensive

    // We don't have to worry about allocating/freeing memory on the heap
    // Once these values are no longer in scope they both go away

    // This is accomplished via the Copy trait, which exists on types like integer
    // that are stored only on the stack

    // Drop and Copy are two traits that cannot coexist on the same type

    // Primitives and scalar values are probably Copy traited
    // Anything more complicated that might require heap allocation is not Copy traited
